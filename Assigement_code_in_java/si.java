/* Write a program to calculate Simple Interest
Simple interest is a quick and easy method of calculating the interest charge on a loan. Simple interest is determined by multiplying the daily interest rate by the principal by the number of days that elapse between payments.
KEY TAKEAWAYS : Simple interest is calculated by multiplying the daily interest rate by the principal, by the number of days that elapse between payments. Simple interest benefits consumers who pay their loans on time or early each month. Auto loans and short-term personal loans are usually simple interest loans.

The Formula for Simple Interest Is:
Simple Interest=PNR/100 where: P=principle R=interest rate N=number of days between payments

Input Format:
Get values for principal amount in the first line rate of interest in the second line number of years in the third line

Constraints:
All three inputs should be > 0

Output Format:
print the calculated simple interest. The result should be rounded to two decimals.

Sample Input :

10000
12
3
Sample Output :

3600.00
